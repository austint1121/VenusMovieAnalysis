## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new fictional movie studio. We
used data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After analyzing the data the group
decided to recommend a genre of movie to make, which month to release the movie in, and how long the movie should be.
The results of our analysis found that the safest genre of movie to make would be an Animated film. We found that movies 
released during the summer would typically have a higher return on investment then any other month. Finally, we found
animated movies typically had the highest return on investment when they were 100 minutes long.
Therefore, we recommended that:

1. Microsoft make an animated movie
2. The studio should release the movie during the summer months
3. The studio should aim to make the movie approx. 100 minutes long.

## Business Problem

Our group was presented the fictional scenario:

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have
decided to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring
what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into
actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
